# Wolf Game - How to Play

## Overview
Wolf Game is an NFT staking game where Sheep earn WOOL tokens and Wolves tax and steal from them.

## The Basics

### Minting NFTs
- **Gen 0 (tokens 1-10,000)**: Mint with ETH
- **Gen 1 (tokens 10,001+)**: Mint with WOOL tokens
- 90% chance of minting a Sheep, 10% chance of Wolf
- Gen 1 mints have a 10% chance of being stolen by a staked Wolf

### Sheep
- Stake sheep in the Barn to earn 10,000 WOOL per day
- When claiming WOOL: 20% goes to Wolves as tax
- When unstaking: 50% chance your sheep gets stolen by a Wolf
- 2-day lock period after staking before you can unstake

### Wolves
- Wolves have an Alpha score (5-8) - higher is better
- Earn WOOL from the 20% tax when Sheep claim
- Higher Alpha = larger share of the tax pool
- Can steal Sheep when they try to unstake
- Can steal newly minted Gen 1 NFTs

## Actions

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| **Stake** | Lock your NFT in the Barn to start earning |
| **Claim** | Collect earned WOOL (Sheep pay 20% tax) |
| **Unstake** | Remove NFT from Barn (Sheep have 50% steal risk) |

## Quick Tips
1. Sheep earn WOOL over time - claim regularly
2. Wolves earn passively from Sheep taxes - no action needed
3. Unstaking Sheep is risky - consider just claiming instead
4. Higher Alpha wolves earn more from the tax pool
